"""Vertical coordinates

This script calculates pressure and geopotential height on full (and half)
model levels of a xr.Dataset.

TODO: finish/update this docstring.

Based on the script of Johannes Horak and later by Deborah Morgenstern.

Inputs:
ds: xr.Dataset containing:
  1. temperature and humidity on model levels
     (optionally also other variables)
  2. logarithm of surface pressure
  3. surface geopotefinal
ecmwf_ab_coeffs.pkl (optional):
  pickle file containing level definitions a and b - can also be downloaded
  in this script if not yet available

Output:
ds: xr.Dataset, which now contains also pressure fields, geopotential and
  geopotential height on all model levels

def get_pressure_and_alpha(ds):
    """Pressure calculations

    Calculate pressure, alpha on full model levels based on Eqns. 2.11, 2.23
    from the [ECMWF]_ documentation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ds : xr.Dataset
        dataset containing the logarithmic surface pressure (data.lnsp)

    Returns
    -------
    pressure : xr.DataArray
        Pressure [Pa] on full model levels
    alpha: xr.DataArray
        Defined at full levels, needed for geopotential calculation
    pressure_ratio: xr.DataArray
        Ratio on pressures on half-levels, needed for calculating geopotential

    Notes
    -----

    The vertical model layers are defined by the pressure at the interfaces
    between them. The pressure :math:`p_{k+1/2}` at those so called
    'half-levels' is given by the following equation (see [ECMWF]_ Eq. 2.11):

    .. math:: p_{k+1/2} = A_{k+1/2} + B_{k+1/2} \cdot p_s.

    Thereby, :math:`A_{k+1/2}` and :math:`B_{k+1/2}` are constants, :math:`p_s`
    represents the surface pressure field.

    The pressure associated with each model level (i.e., at the middle of the
    layer) is defined as the average between the lower and upper half-level.

    .. math::  p_k = \frac{p_{k-1/2} + p_{k+1/2}}{2}

    For the calculation of the geopotential (Eq. 2.22) two more variables are
    needed. The pressure ratio between the surrounding half levels
    :math:`\frac{p_{k+1/2}}{p_{k-1/2}}` and the :math:`\alpha_k` coefficient

    .. math:: \alpha_k = 1 - \frac{p_{k-1/2}}{\Delta{}p_{k}}
        \ln\left(\frac{p_{k+1/2}}{p_{k-1/2}}\right)

    for :math:`k>1` and :math:`\alpha_1 = \ln{}2`.
